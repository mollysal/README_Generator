# <README Generator>
Git Deployment: 

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a high quality README generator. It's important to have a high quality readme for any project on GitHub. A readme allows the user to know what the app is for, it's uses, how to install it & much more. 

## Installation

Please install the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
```bash
npm install inquirer@8.2.0 --save
```
## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
