## README Generator

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to create a high quality README generator. It's important to have a high quality readme for any project on GitHub. A readme allows the user to know what the app is for, it's uses, how to install it & much more. 

## Installation

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js

```
